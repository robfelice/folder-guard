## Critical Path

The fastest path to publication (assuming no blockers):

1. **Week 1:** Phase 1 + Phase 2 (10-15 hours)
   - Days 1-2: Tasks 001-005 (Critical fixes)
   - Days 3-4: Tasks 006-009 (Code quality)

2. **Week 2:** Phase 3 (11-15 hours)
   - Days 1-2: Task 010-011 (Testing)
   - Day 3: Task 012 (Performance)

3. **Week 3:** Phase 4 (11-15 hours)
   - Days 1-2: Tasks 013-015 (Materials)
   - Days 3-4: Tasks 016-017 (Submission prep)

4. **Week 4+:** Phase 5
   - Submit and respond to reviews (timeline depends on reviewers)

**Estimated Total Effort:** 32-45 hours of AI development time
**Estimated Calendar Time:** 3-4 weeks to submission, +1-3 weeks for review

## Parallel Work Opportunities

These tasks can be done in parallel:
- **After Task 001-005:** Tasks 006, 007, 008 can proceed simultaneously
- **After Task 011:** Tasks 013, 014, 015 can proceed simultaneously
- **Documentation tasks** can often overlap with implementation

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Tasks (Require Extra Validation)
- **Task 001:** Decrypt bug - Data loss risk
- **Task 011:** Manual testing - Must be thorough
- **Task 017:** Final review - Gate before publication

### Blocker Risks
- **Testing failures (Task 011):** May require returning to Phase 1
- **Performance issues (Task 012):** May require optimization work
- **Community review (Task 018):** Timeline uncertain

## Notes

- All phases must be completed sequentially (no skipping)
- Critical tasks (marked CRITICAL) are blockers for their phase
- Human review required at phase boundaries
- Testing must be thorough before moving to Phase 4
- Community plugin standards must be met for acceptance

## Legend

- **Status:** Not Started, In Progress, Testing, Awaiting Verification, Completed
- **Priority:** CRITICAL (blocker), HIGH (important), MEDIUM (needed), LOW (nice-to-have)
- **Complexity:** S (Simple, <2h), M (Medium, 2-4h), C (Complex, 4-8h), E (Epic, >8h)
